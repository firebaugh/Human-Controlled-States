"""
ReadFSM class reads text of lua files and generates a list of states and a list of states with their transitions, using the 'get_states' and 'get_transitions' methods, respectively.

*******
You will need to change the path to the lua files since this is based on my account. I guess it would be the same, you just need to change the path to include your account name. Is there a better way to do this?
